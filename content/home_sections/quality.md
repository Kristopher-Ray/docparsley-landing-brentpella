### <span class="font-italic text-seagreen">Quality</span> Over Quantity {.sectionTitle .text-black .mb-2}

The ingredients found in Sleep Remedy serve as precursors to the production of melatonin, rather than dangerously replacing it with a synthetic form. With prolonged use of higher doses of synthetic melatonin, the chances of becoming dependent upon it increases as your body's ability to naturally produce melatonin decreases.

With Sleep Remedy, can safely incorporate into your nightly routine, without risk of creating a dependency over extended use. **When it comes to supplementing, less is more!**
