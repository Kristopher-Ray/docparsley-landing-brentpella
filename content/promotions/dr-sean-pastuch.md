banner_text: <b>“I've struggled with middle of the night wakeups as a
  consequence of having 3 kids.</b> I used to check the clock, but not anymore.
  I wake up refreshed most days, and often get up before my alarm goes off.
  Having Both a bedtime and morning routine is important. The healthier I am the
  better I sleep, the better I sleep the healthier I am."

### What I know:

* As a lifetime athlete, I know the significance of good sleep.
* I truly believe with 8 hours (or more) of sleep is what it takes, as a general guide.
* The PERFECT morning routine begins with the BEST nighttime routine.
* I start each morning hitting the ground, instead of hitting snooze, thanks Sleep Remedy.
