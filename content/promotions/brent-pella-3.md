quote: “As the host of "The Melanie Avalon Biohacking Podcast" and "The
  Intermittent Fasting Podcast," I am constantly researching and exploring the
  best lifestyle practices to optimize one’s health and longevity. Despite being
  inundated with various opinions, recommendations, and scientific findings, I
  can truly say that I believe sleep is the foundation of health! Whenever I am
  interviewed about health and wellness, I always list sleep as the primary
  pillar to focus on, for both lifespan and healthspan! As a self-identified
  insomniac, I have explored many modalities to support sleep. When it comes to
  supplements, Sleep Remedy is a game changer! I love that it provides the exact
  ingredients the brain needs to naturally fall asleep, without tolerance,
  addiction, or other negative side effects. I see a substantial improvement in
  my Oura Ring scores using Sleep Remedy, and constantly receive testimonials
  from listeners, who have experienced this as well! Thank you Kirk Parsley for
  driving awareness about the importance of sleep, and for bringing this product
  to the world! Sweet dreams! <a href="#sleep-store"

### What I know:

* Prioritizing sleep is essential to thrive personally and professionally.
* When you have appropriate quantity and quality sleep, your health, well-being, and work improve. 
* The PERFECT morning routine begins with the BEST nighttime routine.
* I start each morning hitting the ground, instead of hitting snooze, thanks Sleep Remedy.
