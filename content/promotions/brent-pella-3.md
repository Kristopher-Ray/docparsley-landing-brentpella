banner_text: <b>“I used to wake up and get angry right away.</b> Then I realized
  that I was waking up tired, from poor sleep. So I ask you this - have you ever
  considered that instead of being angry...you could be, happy? Have you ever
  considered that the root of our frustrations might very well be in part due to
  a lack of good sleep?”

  who knows how to make the freshest handmade pasta bolognese ever created" -
  I'm just a dude who loves waking up each morning, ready to KNEAD my day like a
  fresh ball of pasta dough. Weird metaphor huh? But it works. Know what else

### What I know:

- As a lifetime athlete, I know the significance of good sleep.
- I truly believe with 8 hours (or more) of sleep, we could solve 99% of the world's problems.
- The PERFECT morning routine begins with the BEST nighttime routine.
- I start each morning hitting the ground, instead of hitting snooze, thanks Sleep Remedy.
