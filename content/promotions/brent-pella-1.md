banner_text: <b>“Apart from breathing clean air and drinking clean water, there
  is nothing more important than "clean sleep"! Our sleep is more important than
  what we eat or how many hours we spend in the gym. Yet, sadly, the modern
  world makes truly optimal sleep nearly impossible which has people relying on
  dirty, disruptive sleep aids and medications just to feel like they're
  sleeping well. Sleep Remedy is the answer. It's truly clean sleep with nothing
  scary for your body to wake up to!”

### What I know:

- As a lifetime athlete, I know the significance of good sleep.
- I truly believe with 8 hours (or more) of sleep, we could solve 99% of the world's problems.
- The PERFECT morning routine begins with the BEST nighttime routine.
- I start each morning hitting the ground, instead of hitting snooze, thanks Sleep Remedy.
