### What I know:

* As a lifetime athlete, I know the significance of good sleep.
* I truly believe with 8 hours (or more) of sleep is what it takes, as a general guide.
* The PERFECT morning routine begins with the BEST nighttime routine.
* I start each morning hitting the ground, instead of hitting snooze, thanks Sleep Remedy.
