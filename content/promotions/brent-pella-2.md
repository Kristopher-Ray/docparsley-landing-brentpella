### What I know:

- As a lifetime athlete, I know the significance of good sleep.
- I truly believe with 8 hours (or more) of sleep, we could solve 99% of the world's problems.
- The PERFECT morning routine begins with the BEST nighttime routine.
- I start each morning hitting the ground, instead of hitting snooze, thanks Sleep Remedy.
