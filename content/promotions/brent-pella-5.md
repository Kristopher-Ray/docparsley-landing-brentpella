quote: “I have struggled with sleep for as long as I can remember.  If there is
  a product or a practice, I’ve tried it—supplements, acupuncture, meditation,
  warm baths, breath work, sauna, hot baths, cold room, bright light, eye masks,
  weighted blankets, weed. You name it. It has taken this journey for me to
  really understand how much good sleep hygiene impacts your day to day
  well-being, and how damaging it can be when you sleep poorly or
  inconsistently. This is the kind of info that once you know it, you can’t put
  that genie back in the bottle.  It's still a work in progress, but I’m happy
  to say that I’ve finally found my own personal protocol that works more often
  than it doesn’t, and Sleep Remedy is a big part of that.  <a

### What I know:

* As a wellness entrepreneur, I know the significance of good sleep.
* I truly believe with 8 hours (or more) of sleep, we could solve 99% of the world's problems.
* The PERFECT morning routine begins with the BEST nighttime routine.
* I start each morning hitting the ground, instead of hitting snooze, thanks Sleep Remedy.
