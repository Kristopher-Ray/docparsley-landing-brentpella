banner_text: <i><strong>“I used to wake up and get angry right away.</strong> Then I realized that I was waking up tired, from poor sleep. So I ask you this - have you ever considered that instead of being angry...you could be, happy? Have you ever considered that the root of our frustrations might very well be in part due to a lack of good sleep?”</i>

### What I know:

- As a lifetime athlete, I know the significance of good sleep.
- I truly believe with 8 hours (or more) of sleep, we could solve 99% of the world's problems.
- The PERFECT morning routine begins with the BEST nighttime routine.
- I start each morning hitting the ground, instead of hitting snooze, thanks Sleep Remedy.
