quote: “As small business owners, parents, and health advocates, David and Josh
  know that quality sleep is a key component to overall wellness.  To perform at
  a high level at work, then be a good parent and husband, sleep has to be
  factored into the equation equally with exercise and nutrition.  The
  ingredients in Sleep Remedy can make sure we get the restful and rebuilding
  night we need when used as part of a quality sleep hygiene regimen.”</a>

### What we know:

* stress in any form impacts sleep negatively and the long-term implications of that can be severe.
* Quality, restful, uninterrupted sleep is key to overall health.
* The PERFECT morning routine begins with the BEST nighttime routine.
* I start each morning hitting the ground, instead of hitting snooze, thanks Sleep Remedy.
